# Puzzle -carousel challenge

The challenge given proposed to implement an image carousel in React-Native without using any libraries for it. My idea was to provide different solutions:

<img src='./assets/demo.gif'/>

- First, a common flatlist with no bounces

- Second, an animated carousel. This particulary only works on the Android simulator, and I couldn't figure out why this happens. Also, I couldn't handle both animation and useState changes, so it doesn't work properly.

- Third, and last, a paginated carousel

### To run the app you should follow the upcoming instructions:

1. Clone this repository copying its URL and typing <code>git clone "url"</code> on the console being located on the folder where you want to access to it locally
2. Type <code>cd puzzle-carousel</code> on console
3. <code>npm install</code>
4. <code>npm start</code>

Now, if you have an Android Emulator (Like Android Studio), you can select the **Run on Android Device/Emulator** option.

Also if you have an iOS emulator(like xCode), you can select the **Run on iOS emulator** option

Or you can simply scan the QR Code on the left corner below with your mobile to run it on your device(this requires the **Expo Go** App available on both Play Store and App Store)
